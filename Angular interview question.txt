- difference between type and interface
- what is dependency injection
- types of data binding

A quick tip that helps me remember what they do -

HostBinding('value') myValue; is exactly the same as [value]="myValue"
And
HostListener('click') myClick(){ } is exactly the same as (click)="myClick()"

HostBinding and HostListener are written in directives and the other ones (...) and [..] are written inside templates (of components).
